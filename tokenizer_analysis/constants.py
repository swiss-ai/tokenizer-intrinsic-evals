# tokens, the check is a WARNING. Round-trip can still succeed via multi-token
# fallback (that is what C1 tests), but a strict alphabet is needed for deterministic
# single-token encoding of every byte and to give the LM a real embedding slot for
# each byte. Missing valid UTF-8 lead bytes (0xC2-0xF4) affect text in Supplementary

# C16: count of normalization-unreachable vocab tokens (the introspectable normalizer
# folds the surface to something else, so NO input can ever produce the token). Above

# signals a vocab built without applying the normalizer, a construction defect distinct
# from a merely wasted pretokenizer slot.

# pretokenizer boundaries (e.g. SuperBPE superwords). If encoding it emits any token
